 * The 'lol' language has only two verb: 'ololoo' and 'olalaa'.
 * The infinitive coinsides to vocabular stem.
 * Present time of the verb forms by shorthening of the last vowel.
 * Past time forms by replacing of the first vowel 'o' to any other vowel.
 * Note that here we using mutation wildcards (a>aa,o>oo) and (*>o) from

/*
 * Match specification is the powerful easy mechanism for words recognision.
 * Each regular match expression has 3 mode:
 *
 *   '=' match mode:
 *         only comparation.
 *   '+' rift mode:
 *         comparation and rifting from subword copy,
 *         appending detached part to rule 'value' field that could be
 *         found in the output generated files.
 *   '-' hold mode (comparation and holding)
 *         comparation and holding (not detaching),
 *         appending holded part to rule 'value' field that could be
 *         found in the output generated files.
 *
 * Here we are using mutations. Mutations applicable to the edge of the
 * current subword copy only.
 *
 * Example:               /* meaning */
 *   -u(*>o)=e            /* vowel 'u' following vowel 'e'
 *                           ('ue' -> 'oe' for '.forward' rules)
 *                           ('ue' -> 'uo' for '.backward' rules) */
 *   -u(a>aa,o>oo)(*>o)=e /* vowel 'u' following by vowel 'e'
 *                           ('ue' -> never match for '.forward' rules)
 *                           ('ue' -> 'uoo' for '.backward' rules) */
